About this template
===================

For an overview of Markdeep and its syntax, see the [official demo document](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html) and the associated [source code](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html?noformat).
This template is based on the one used in CS440 - Advanced Computer Graphics.

Exercise writeup
================

(##) 4.2.5 Asymptotic Path

Using your implemented functions, you can visualize the asymptotic curve network for the inputs
given in assignment_2_4/notebook/tracing_test.ipynb (Figure 15). Report screenshots of the
outputs.

<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="sol.png" alt="" width="500">
</div>

(##) 4.2.6 Asymptotic Grid Shell

You can use the design_tool to upload your minimal surface and interactively design your
asymptotic curve network. For this part of the assignment, you need to report screenshots of the
design outputs. Take screenshots showing most of the features of your a-shell.

About this template
===================

For an overview of Markdeep and its syntax, see the [official demo document](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html) and the associated [source code](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html?noformat).
This template is based on the one used in CS440 - Advanced Computer Graphics.
